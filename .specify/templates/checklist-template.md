<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.
  
  The /speckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific checklist request
  - Feature requirements from spec.md
  - Technical context from plan.md
  - Implementation details from tasks.md
  
  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.

- [ ] CHK006 Final item in this category

## Error Testing *(MANDATORY per Constitution Principle IX)*

- [ ] CHK-ERR-001 Verify ALL sentinel errors in `services/errors.go` have test cases
- [ ] CHK-ERR-002 Verify ALL HTTP error codes in `handlers/error_codes.go` have test cases
- [ ] CHK-ERR-003 Verify error wrapping uses `fmt.Errorf("%w", err)` (NOT `%v`)
- [ ] CHK-ERR-004 Verify error checking uses `errors.Is()` (NOT string comparison)
- [ ] CHK-ERR-005 Verify complete error flow tested: Service → Handler → Client
- [ ] CHK-ERR-006 Verify context errors tested (cancellation, timeout)
- [ ] CHK-ERR-007 Run error test suite: `go test -v -run "TestAll.*Errors"`
- [ ] CHK-ERR-008 Confirm 100% error test coverage (no untested errors)

## Continuous Test Verification *(MANDATORY per Constitution Principle VII)*

**Note**: AI agents MUST run tests locally after ALL code changes

- [ ] CHK-TEST-001 Verify AI agent ran full test suite after implementation
- [ ] CHK-TEST-002 Verify all tests pass (green) - NO task completion with failing tests
- [ ] CHK-TEST-003 Verify tests with race detector pass (concurrency safety)
- [ ] CHK-TEST-004 Verify test coverage is maintained or improved
- [ ] CHK-TEST-005 Verify AI agent ran tests after refactoring changes
- [ ] CHK-TEST-006 Verify integration tests pass with real database (testcontainers)
- [ ] CHK-TEST-007 Verify no tests were skipped or disabled to complete task
- [ ] CHK-TEST-008 Verify flaky tests are fixed (not ignored)
- [ ] CHK-TEST-009 Verify test failures were reported and fixed
- [ ] CHK-TEST-010 Verify task only marked complete after all tests passed

## Root Cause Tracing *(MANDATORY per Constitution Principle VIII)*

**Note**: AI agents MUST trace problems to source and fix there, NOT work around symptoms

- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-001 Verify bugs have documented root cause analysis
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-002 Verify fixes address root causes, not symptoms
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-003 Verify NO test cases were removed to make tests pass
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-004 Verify NO test expectations were weakened to accommodate bugs
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-005 Verify NO workarounds added instead of proper fixes
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-006 Verify problem traced backward through call chain to original trigger
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-007 Verify fix implemented at source location (not symptom location)
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-008 Verify tests validate correct behavior (not broken behavior)
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-009 Verify flaky tests are fixed at root cause (not skipped)
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-010 Verify commit message documents root cause trace for bug fixes
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-011 Verify no "quick fixes" that lack understanding
- [ ] CHK-DEBUG-012 Verify AI agent resisted temptation to "just make it work"

**Root Cause Tracing Process**:
1. Document symptom clearly
2. Trace backward through call chain
3. Identify original trigger (root cause)
4. Fix at source
5. Verify fix with tests
6. Document tracing process

**Anti-Patterns to Reject**:
- ❌ Removing failing test cases
- ❌ Changing test expectations to match broken behavior
- ❌ Adding `t.Skip()` to flaky tests
- ❌ Relaxing assertions ("at least" instead of "exactly")
- ❌ Adding conditional workarounds
- ❌ Catching and ignoring errors without understanding

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
