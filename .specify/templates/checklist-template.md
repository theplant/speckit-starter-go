## Error Testing *(MANDATORY per Constitution Principle IX)*

- [ ] CHK-ERR-001 Verify ALL sentinel errors in `services/errors.go` have test cases
- [ ] CHK-ERR-002 Verify ALL HTTP error codes in `handlers/error_codes.go` have test cases
- [ ] CHK-ERR-003 Verify error wrapping uses `fmt.Errorf("%w", err)` (NOT `%v`)
- [ ] CHK-ERR-004 Verify error checking uses `errors.Is()` (NOT string comparison)
- [ ] CHK-ERR-005 Verify complete error flow tested: Service → Handler → Client
- [ ] CHK-ERR-006 Verify context errors tested (cancellation, timeout)
- [ ] CHK-ERR-007 Run error test suite: `go test -v -run "TestAll.*Errors"`
- [ ] CHK-ERR-008 Confirm 100% error test coverage (no untested errors)

## Continuous Test Verification *(MANDATORY per Constitution Principle XI)*

**Note**: AI agents MUST run tests locally after ALL code changes

- [ ] CHK-TEST-001 Verify AI agent ran full test suite after implementation
- [ ] CHK-TEST-002 Verify all tests pass (green) - NO task completion with failing tests
- [ ] CHK-TEST-003 Verify tests with race detector pass (concurrency safety)
- [ ] CHK-TEST-004 Verify test coverage is maintained or improved
- [ ] CHK-TEST-005 Verify AI agent ran tests after refactoring changes
- [ ] CHK-TEST-006 Verify integration tests pass with real database (testcontainers)
- [ ] CHK-TEST-007 Verify no tests were skipped or disabled to complete task
- [ ] CHK-TEST-008 Verify flaky tests are fixed (not ignored)
- [ ] CHK-TEST-009 Verify test failures were reported and fixed
- [ ] CHK-TEST-010 Verify task only marked complete after all tests passed
